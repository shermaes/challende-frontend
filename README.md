# To-Do App

This is an app that will help you manage your daily tasks.

## How would I install this

First, clone this [backend](https://github.com/shermaes/challenge-backend) into your local.

For it to run as expected, you need to have Laragon installed. 
SQLyog is needed so you can create the schema where you will be working. (categories).

Now, clone this frontend repository into your local and open your terminal so you can use the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
Open the backend using your preferred IDE and run the application. Remember that you need to start Laragon on the background.

Now, open the frontend part on VSC and run the next command on the console:

```bash
npm run dev
```
You will get something like this:

```bash
PS C:\Users\sheri\OneDrive\Escritorio\toDoFront\to-do-front> npm run dev  

> to-do-front@0.0.0 dev
> vite

Port 3000 is in use, trying another one...

  vite v2.9.8 dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:3001/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 990ms.
```
Copy that URL and paste it on your preferred browser and you will be ready to use the app.

## With this you can...

-Create a category and add tasks there.

-Edit your tasks.

-Delete tasks.

-Mark tasks as done.

-Delete complete categories of tasks.


## What did I learn on this project
This project is my first step to becoming a full stack developer and I'm proud on what I've achieved with it until now. 

Now I know the basics on SpringBoot, how to connect a database to the backend and the connect that backend to the frontend.

I learned that it is easier to start with the backend when creating and app. This way you will know what data you'll be needing and you'll be defining what to do with that data.

Now the only thing that is left is to get better at frontend.

## Enjoy your own learning path!
